## 🚀 Key Features

*   **⚡ VPN Protocols**:
    *   **AmneziaWG (AWG / AWG 2.0 / AWG Legacy)**: Advanced WireGuard-based protocol with S3/S4 obfuscation to bypass deep packet inspection (DPI). Three coexisting variants — modern AWG 2.0 with full junk-packet masking, and a legacy variant for older clients.
    *   **Classic WireGuard**: Standard, high-performance WireGuard protocol for unmatched speed and broad device compatibility with traffic monitoring support.
    *   **Xray (XTLS-Reality)**: Stealthy protocol that masks VPN traffic as standard HTTPS browsing. Pinned to **Xray-core v26.x**; transparently reads both the **panel layout** (`meta.json` + `clientsTable.json`) and the **native Amnezia client layout** (`xray_*.key` files + `clientsTable`), so a node first installed via the official mobile/desktop app can be attached to the panel without re-installation.
    *   **Telemt (Telegram MTProxy)**: High-performance Telegram MTProxy with TLS emulation and comprehensive management (quotas, IP limits, real-time session tracking). Robust install path that auto-configures Docker's official apt/yum repository when needed.
    *   **Cloudflare WARP**: Add and manage WARP-powered connectivity from the panel for routing and network flexibility.
*   **🛠 Services**:
    *   **AmneziaDNS**: Internal DNS resolver on a private docker network (`amnezia-dns-net`, IP `172.29.172.254`) to prevent DNS leaks and blockings.
    *   **AdGuard Home**: DNS-based ad blocker with a web admin UI. Two install modes: **Replace AmneziaDNS** (takes its IP, all VPN clients use AdGuard immediately) or **Side-by-side** (parallel deployment on `172.29.172.253`, web UI accessible only over the VPN by default). Optional opt-in checkboxes to expose the web UI / DoT / DoH on the host.
    *   **SOCKS5 Proxy**: Single-account 3proxy-based SOCKS5 server modelled after the official Amnezia client. Auto-generated 16-character password on install, port and credentials editable later from the panel without re-install.
    *   **NGINX + Let's Encrypt**: Reverse-proxy and HTTPS automation with certificate management for secure public endpoints.
*   **⚙️ Core Server Management**:
    *   **Add / Edit / Delete / Reorder** server entries — drag-and-drop reorder updates `server_id` references in saved connections automatically.
    *   **Live ping indicator** next to each server name — non-blocking TCP-connect probe to the SSH port, runs on the asyncio loop in parallel for all servers.
    *   **Clear server** wipes every Amnezia-related container, image and `/opt/amnezia` directory in a single sudo script — works for any current or future `amnezia-*` protocol.
    *   **Reboot** the server directly from the UI.
    *   Strictly concurrent protocol status polling — all supported protocols/services checked in parallel for immediate feedback.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing**: Resilient, non-blocking background architecture prevents the UI panel from freezing, even if remote endpoints hang.
*   **🧩 Marketplace & Templates**:
    *   Market templates provide quick presets for installing and configuring supported protocols and services.
    *   Multi-protocol management lets you run and control multiple protocol instances on the same server.
*   **🌐 Internationalization (i18n)**:
    *   Full support for **English**, **Russian**, **French**, **Chinese**, and **Persian**.
    *   Native **RTL (Right-to-Left)** support for Persian language.
*   **👥 Advanced User Management**:
    *   Role-based access (Admin, Support, Regular User).
    *   Traffic limits, status monitoring, and account expiration.
    *   One-click user enabling/disabling.
*   **🎨 Premium UI/UX**:
    *   Stunning glassmorphism design.
    *   Dynamic **Dark/Light** mode transition.
    *   Fully responsive for mobile and desktop.
*   **🤖 Telegram Bot Integration**:
    *   Notify users about new connections or limits.
    *   Integrated management via Telegram commands.
    *   Admin-role workflows for managing servers, protocols, users, and connections directly from Telegram.
*   **🔄 Built-in Update Checker**:
    *   View your current panel version directly in Settings.
    *   One-click check for fresh GitHub releases to stay up to date.
*   **📤 Data Interoperability**:
    *   **Remnawave Sync**: Automatically import and sync users from Remnawave.
    *   **Simple Backup**: Effortless JSON-based export and restore of all panel data.
    *   **Profile transfer between VPS**: Move an individual client to another managed VPS with the same protocol installed. The panel creates the replacement profile first, removes the source profile only after success, updates linked users and self-service claims, and records the action in the audit log.
    *   **Backup / Migrate protocols (Alpha)**: Move protocol configurations between nodes for maintenance, recovery, and migration workflows.
*   **🔗 Public Sharing**:
    *   Generate password-protected links for users to download their configurations without panel access.
*   **🌍 One-click Public Tunnels**:
    *   Open the local panel to the internet from `/settings` using **Cloudflare Quick Tunnel** or **ngrok**.
    *   Shows the local server URL, installation state, running state, and issued public HTTPS URLs directly in the UI.
    *   Supports one-click install, enable, stop, and delete for panel-managed tunnel binaries.
    *   Persists tunnel PID/public URL state across panel restarts and can detect already running tunnel processes.
    *   Works on Windows, Linux, and Docker-friendly environments; `TUNNEL_BIN_DIR` and `TUNNEL_STATE_FILE` can override binary/state locations.
*   **🔑 API Tokens for External Integrations**:
    *   Issue bearer tokens from `/settings` for CI bots, monitoring, or any third-party service.
    *   Panel never stores the raw token — only its SHA-256 hash. The full value is shown **once** at creation; lose it and you must rotate.
    *   Tokens inherit the role of the admin who created them and are revoked automatically if that user is disabled or demoted.
    *   Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with any admin endpoint — every endpoint that accepts a session also accepts a token, no other changes.

## 🔧 Project Details

### API Documentation

The project includes self-documenting API endpoints, organised into clear tag groups:

*   **Swagger UI**: `/docs`
*   **ReDoc**: `/redoc` (pinned to a stable bundle, Google Fonts disabled — works on networks where they're blocked)

Routes are grouped in the docs as:

| Group | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **System Templates** | HTML pages served to browsers (login, server detail, settings, /share). Not part of the JSON API. |
| **Authentication** | Login, captcha, session lifecycle. |
| **Servers** | Server inventory & host-level operations (add/edit/delete, ping, reorder, reboot, clear, stats). |
| **Protocols** | Install / uninstall / container / raw-config editing for every protocol & service on a server. |
| **Connections** | Per-protocol VPN client connections (CRUD, enable/disable, fetch config, transfer a profile to another managed VPS). |
| **Users** | Panel user accounts and the connections assigned to them. |
| **Self-service** | Endpoints called by a regular user for their own data (`/api/my/*`). |
| **Sharing** | Public, token-protected configuration sharing — no panel session required. |
| **Settings** | Panel-wide settings, Telegram bot, Remnawave sync, JSON backup/restore. |
| **API Tokens** | Create and revoke bearer tokens for external integrations. |

**Authentication for external integrations** — both session cookies and `Authorization: Bearer <token>` are accepted on every admin endpoint. Example:

```bash
TOKEN="awp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# List panel users
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://your-panel:5000/api/users

# Add a server
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"host":"1.2.3.4","username":"root","password":"...","name":"new-srv"}' \
  http://your-panel:5000/api/servers/add

# Cheap reachability probe for monitoring
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://your-panel:5000/api/servers/0/ping
```

### Profile Transfer Between VPS

An administrator can transfer an individual client profile from one managed VPS
to another through the connection card in the server UI or through the API:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"protocol":"awg","client_id":"CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY","target_server_id":1}' \
  http://your-panel:5000/api/servers/0/connections/transfer
```

The source and target must be different managed servers and the target must
already have the same protocol installed. Supported profile protocols are
AmneziaWG variants, WireGuard, Xray, Telemt, and AIVPN. The target profile is
created before the source profile is removed; a failed source removal triggers
a rollback of the target client. The response includes the new configuration,
which must replace the old one on the user's device.

### Technology Stack
*   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), `asyncio` for concurrent SSH/probe work
*   **Frontend**: Vanilla JS, Jinja2, Custom CSS (Glassmorphism, full set of CSS animations for promo blocks)
*   **Database**: Local JSON storage (`data.json`) with an `asyncio.Lock` for thread-safe writes
*   **SSH Engine**: Paramiko

## 🛡 Security Recommendations

*   **Reverse Proxy**: It is highly recommended to run the panel behind Nginx/Apache with an SSL certificate.
*   **SSH Keys**: Use SSH keys rather than passwords for connecting to your VPN servers.
*   **Secret Key**: Set a custom `SECRET_KEY` environment variable for secure session management.
*   **API Tokens**: Treat each token like a password — store it in your integration's secret manager. Revoke it from `/settings` if it leaks or the integration is decommissioned. Rotate periodically; tokens inherit admin rights.
